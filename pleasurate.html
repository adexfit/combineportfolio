            <h2 class="colored_heading">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              The real estate industry has been rapidly growing in recent years, with the emergence of new technologies and mobile applications making it easier for people to buy, sell, and rent properties. In this case study, I will be discussing the design process I used to create a cutting-edge real estate mobile application.
            </p>

            <h2 class="colored_heading">Background</h2>
            <p>
              As a leading real estate company, my client wanted to revolutionize the way people buy and sell and rent properties by creating a mobile application that would provide a seamless user experience. They approached me with the goal of developing an innovative app that would allow users to easily search for properties, view detailed information, and connect with agents. My challenge was to design a user interface that would be visually appealing, intuitive, and meet the needs of my client's target audience. 
            </p>
            <p>
              This project lasted 4 months , and I was the only product designer who worked on it.

                <h2 class="colored_heading">Understanding the problem</h2>
                <p> This project was done to solve the following problems in the real estate industry:
 
                  <ol class="list">
                    <li>
                      <b>Limited access to property information:</b> In the traditional real estate industry, property information was only available through agents or brokers. This made it difficult for buyers to access information about properties they were interested in, and sellers had limited ways to market their properties. This project was done to make property information readily accessible to clients.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Time-consuming property search:</b> Searching for properties can be a time-consuming process, especially for those who are not familiar with the area they are searching in. There is therefore a need to develop a mobile app that can make the process faster and more efficient by providing users with a comprehensive list of properties that match their search criteria.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Lack of transparency:</b> The real estate industry has been criticized for its lack of transparency in the past. With a mobile app, buyers and sellers can access real-time information about properties, including pricing, location, and other relevant details.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Limited communication with agents:</b> Traditional real estate transactions often require buyers and sellers to communicate with agents through phone calls or emails.  There is a need for a mobile app that can provide a platform for users to communicate with agents in real-time, making the process more efficient and streamlined.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Inefficient property management:</b> Property management can be a complex process, especially for those who own multiple properties. This project will provide a centralized platform for property owners to manage their properties, including maintenance requests, rent payments, and other important tasks.
                    </li>
                  </ol>

                <h3 class="colored_heading">Research</h3>
                <p>
                  To begin the design process, I conducted extensive research on the target audience of the application. 
                  The target audience include:
                  <ol class="list">
                    <li>
                      <b>Homebuyers:</b> Individuals who are looking to purchase a property for personal use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Real estate investors:</b> Individuals who are interested in purchasing properties as an investment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Renters:</b> Individuals who are looking to rent a property for personal or business use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Property owners:</b> Individuals who own one or more properties and need a platform to manage their properties efficiently.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Real estate agents:</b> Professionals who work in the real estate industry and require a platform to connect with clients and manage their listings.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I did a qualitative research using 5 Homebuyers, 5 Real estate investors, 5 Renters, 5 Property owners and 5 Real estate agents. I analyzed their behaviors, preferences, and pain points. 
                  I also conducted a competitive audit to identify the strength and weaknesses of our competitors and the areas for improvement.

            <div class="text__column">

                  <li>
                    Homebuyers prefer a mobile app that allows them to easily search for properties based on their specific criteria, such as location, price range, and number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Real estate investors want a mobile app that provides them with detailed property information, including rental income potential, property taxes, and other financial data.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Renters are looking for a mobile app that allows them to easily search for available rental properties in their preferred location, view photos and virtual tours, and communicate with landlords or property managers.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Property owners want a mobile app that enables them to manage their properties remotely, including scheduling maintenance and repairs, viewing financial reports, and communicating with tenants.

              <h2 class="colored_heading">Design</h2>
                <p>Based on the research findings, I developed a user interface design that focused on simplicity and ease of use. 
                  I used a clean and modern design language with a simple color palette to create a visually appealing interface that would be easy to navigate. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also focused on creating a seamless user experience by incorporating intuitive navigation and clear calls to action. 
                  I used icons and graphics to help users quickly identify key features and functions of the application.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the key features of the application was the ability to search for properties based on specific criteria such as location, price range, and property type. 
                  To make this process as easy as possible, I designed a search bar that was prominently displayed on the home screen. I also included filters that allowed users to refine their search results based on additional criteria such as number of bedrooms or bathrooms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another important feature of the application was the ability to view property details such as photos, floor plans, and amenities. I designed a property detail page that displayed all relevant information in a clear and organized manner.
